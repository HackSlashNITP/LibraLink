# LibraLink - Revolutionizing the Library Experience

In an era of technological advancements, the **LibraLink** project aims to revolutionize the library experience at NIT Patna. This innovative application seeks to bridge the gap between traditional library services and modern digital convenience. By introducing a phased approach, the project endeavors to provide users with an efficient solution for book tracking, due date management, and resource access. This README outlines the motivation, objectives, and scope of the project, offering insights into how **LibraLink** can reshape the way our library operates and caters to users' needs.

## Motivation

Libraries have always been a treasure trove of knowledge, but in today's fast-paced digital world, they need to adapt and offer a more user-centric experience. The motivation behind LibraLink is to enhance the library experience for NIT Patna students and staff, making it easier to access and manage resources.

  - User history: Access a history of borrowed books and interactions.
  - Static shelf location maps: Find books easily with static location maps.
  - Integration with external e-library platforms: Access digital resources seamlessly.

- **Phase 2 (Future):**
  - Automation of book entry: Streamline the process of adding new books.
  - Real-time status updates: Know the availability of books instantly.
